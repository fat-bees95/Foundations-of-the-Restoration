  <p>Imagine being a new convert to the Lord’s restored Church in Joseph Smith’s time.</p>

  <p>Your view of Heavenly Father’s plan would have been incomplete. If you had been raised as a Christian, you might have had beliefs similar to the following:</p>

  <p>(1) God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are one God, without body, parts, or passions;</p>
  <p>(2) Humans had no existence prior to this life, and they were created by God out of nothing;</p>
  <p>(3) God is unknowable and mysterious—the idea of humans being His children is only a metaphor.</p>
